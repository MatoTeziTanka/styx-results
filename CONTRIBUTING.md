# Contributing to STYX Benchmark Results

Thanks for your interest in STYX. Here's how you can contribute.

## What This Repo Contains

This repository contains **benchmark results and methodology** for STYX (Selective Token Yield eXtraction). It does not contain the STYX algorithm itself, which is patent-pending (#63/975,190).

## How You Can Help

### Methodology Feedback
Found a flaw in the benchmark design? Have suggestions for stronger validation? Open an issue with the `methodology` label. We take statistical rigor seriously.

### Reproduce the Benchmarks
The benchmark files describe what was tested and how. If you run similar comparisons using the same public data sources (GitHub API, HuggingFace datasets) and get different results, we want to know. Open an issue with your findings.

### Suggest New Benchmarks
Want to see STYX tested on a specific document type, language, or scale? Open an issue with the `benchmark-request` label.

### Report Data Issues
If you spot an error in the benchmark JSON files or README, open an issue or submit a PR.

## What We Can't Accept

- **Algorithm contributions** — The core extraction algorithm is proprietary and patent-pending
- **Requests for source code** — The algorithm is not in this repo and will not be shared
- **Raw + compressed text comparisons** — We do not publish input/output comparisons to protect IP

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. Technical disagreement is welcome. Personal attacks are not.
